== 我们是谁

Jenkins 项目是一个相关于 Jenkins 软件的社区。我们是一群热爱开源，着眼于开发，使用，提升 Jenkins 软件功能开发者，以及其他进行相关利益活动的人员。

本项目附属于 link:http://www.spi-inc.org/[Software in the Public Interest] (SPI)。SPI 是一个非盈利组织，提供必要的法律保护和开源软件运作需要的帮助。它也是本项目的法律上的拥有者和资产管理者。

== 我们的哲学

=== 低门槛

我们努力的降低加入本项目的门槛，就如我们接纳所有人的提交，而不要求提交者通过某些方式来证明其有这个能力。另外我们认为每个人都是优秀的，除非他们自己经常犯错，我们对所有人都一视同仁。我们认为每个人的贡献都非常珍贵，所以任何多余的流程都是对吸引潜在的贡献者的阻碍。

Jenkins 核心项目，插件，模块，以及独立的相关项目都采取低门槛策略，以便于减少参与和交流的阻碍。我们也努力的让每个人都找到他们自己舒适的工作方式，以便于高效，没有冲突的合作。我们认为每个人都有表达他们自己想法的权利。

相信人们的进步也是低门槛策略的原因。本项目的很多代码都是不原作者在维护。我们也鼓励新来者接管老的项目。我们认为早的贡献者应该充分的尊重新的贡献者，原始贡献者的不作为不应阻止新贡献者做出改变。

=== 任人唯贤

我们推行低门槛方式，并不意味着每个人在社区里都有相同分量。我们会衡量每个人的贡献价值，来给与不同的责任和权力，即 link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy[任人唯贤]。贡献不仅仅停留在代码修改，还包括对其他人的帮助，如 PR，维护基础设施等等。

=== 公开透明

我们公开透明的管理项目，这包括从决策到代码变更的所有事情。

=== 兼容性问题

我们认识到，用户希望现有的版本可以兼容现他们过去积累的数据（包括Hudson 升级到 1.395），包括在 Jenkins 的未来版本中也能正常运作。这写数据包括他们正在使用的作业配置，构建记录和插件二进制文件。Jenkins项目非常重视维护这种兼容性，并且在删除功能时会非常小心。

我们还认识到插件开发人员希望他们所依赖的API和其他代码在 Jenkins 的未来版本中仍然可用。这并不是说我们永远不会删除任何内容，但我们会非常谨慎地执行此操作。

因为一个插件可以依赖于另一个插件，所以我们期望许多其他插件所依赖的插件具有相同的原理。

=== 自动化

Jenkins 项目的目标之一是实现更多自动化，我们在开发 Jenkins 时应用相同的原则。因此，我们开发并使用许多守护进程，机器人和脚本来执行本务活动和日常操作。

这不仅节省了我们做更多创造性工作的时间，而且还通过减少一个开发人员被另一个开发人员的阻塞来帮助减少进入障碍。此外，它还使我们的测试受益。

== 许可证

Jenkins项目使用 link:http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT[MIT 许可证] 作为我们开发的代码的首选许可证。除非另有说明，否则所有代码均在 MIT 许可下。

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins[Jenkins 的核心]完全在MIT许可下，我们的大多数基础设施代码（运行项目本身的）以及许多插件都是如此。我们鼓励托管插件使用相同的 MIT 许可证，以简化用户使用流程，但插件可以自由选择自己的许可证，只要它是 OSI 批准的开源许可证。

这不应该与专有插件相混淆 - 我们认识并鼓励人们自己编写以供内部使用的插件，而不必使源代码可用。但 Jenkins 项目不会托管这样的插件。

[[cla]]

=== 贡献者许可协议 (CLA)

为了进一步明确项目的知识产权，我们要求核心提交者签署贡献者协议。此 CLA 与 Apache 的 CLA 相同。本协议明确赋予 SPI 一组权利，例如有效的联合版权所有权，专利授权，以及承认您拥有贡献的权限。

将这些权利分配给SPI有助于Jenkins对任何特定供应商保持中立，并且它还会使法律部门感到高兴，特别是在想要使用Jenkins的大型组织中。

CLA 有两种类型。每个核心贡献者都需要签署个人 CLA（ICLA），如果您不独自拥有您的贡献（例如当您的公司指派您参与 Jenkins 工作，因此如果您的公司拥有您的辛勤贡献，则公司也需要签署公司 CLA（CCLA）。有关更多详细信息，请参阅 link:https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas[Apache 中的讨论]。可以从以下URL获取CLA表单：

* link:https://raw.github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla/approved/icla.txt[ICLA]
* link:https://raw.github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla/approved/ccla.txt[CCLA]

为了平衡额外的开销和较低的进入门槛，此政策仅适用于核心，我们欢迎任何愿意为插件贡献者提交 CLA。

提交CLA的详细信息记录在 link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla/blob/master/README.md[infra-cla README] 自述文件中。

=== 核心中的第三方库许可证

Jenkins 项目在很大程度上依赖于第三方库。我们认为，重用我们的能力比重新发明更好，这样我们的宝贵资源就可以用在其他地方。

Jenkins 作为一个整体需要成为一个开源项目，所以我们一直限制自己只使用 link:http://www.opensource.org/[OSI 认可的开源许可证的第三方库]（例如 Apache 软件许可证，BSD 许可证，MIT 许可证，Eclipse Public）许可证和较​​小的 GNU 公共许可证。）此外，为了使核心可以重复使用最广泛的用例，我们拒绝所谓的 link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft[copyleft licenses] 许可证，将许可证限制为特定许可证（例如 GNU 公共许可证）。最终，我们将以下许可证指定为我们可以依赖的已批准许可证。其他许可证需经董事会批准：

* link:http://www.apache.org/licenses/[Apache 软件许可证]
* link:http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php[BSD 许可证], link:http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php[MIT 许可证]
* link:http://opensource.org/licenses/W3C.php[W3C 软件许可证]
* link:http://opensource.org/licenses/cddl1.php[CDDL], link:http://opensource.org/licenses/cpl1.0.php[CPL], link:http://opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php[EPL], 和 link:http://opensource.org/licenses/mozilla1.0.php[MPL], 以及 link:http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php[LGPL] 这些许可证要求衍生产品与原始许可证的许可证相同，因此源代码需要分离到自己的存储库中，但二进制文件可以用作依赖项核心。）

In core, the build process ensure that all the licenses of the dependency libraries are accounted for. In other words, we require that dependency POMs declare their own licenses in the Maven way, or use link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/licenseCompleter.groovy[the license completion script] to supply one where the POM is missing that information. The completion script is also used in case the library is dual-licensed to pick a specific license. This is done so that the summary list of the 3rd party library licenses do not include copy-left licenses.

结果打包到核心中，并且可以从 link:https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/about[应用程序本身] 中看到。它也可以在 war 文件中以 XML 格式提供。

=== 插件中的第三方库许可证

在涉及第三方许可证政策时，插件不一定遵循相同的形式。显然他们需要尊重他们使用的库的许可证，所以他们不需要使用与核心使用的相同许可证方案。

我们鼓励插件遵循相同的第三方许可证策略作为核心。但是后果需要自负，更多信息 link:https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#NFUseGPLPlugins[FSF 对使用非GPL核心的GPL插件的看法]。

== 商标

为了保护项目和用户不会混淆使用该术语，“Jenkins” 这个名称是美国的注册商标(link:https://trademarks.justia.com/854/47/jenkins-85447465.html[#4664929]，由 link:http://spi-inc.org[Software in the Public Interest, Inc.] 持有）。为了减少流程开销并维护我们的开源精神，我们采用Linux内核策略来使用商标。

如果您使用术语 “Jenkins” 作为您自己的基于Jenkins的软件商品或服务的商标或品牌标识符的一部分，则需要申请 link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Trademark+Sublicense[sublicense]。如果您的商标未注册，或者您不打算使用该商标赚钱，则无关所谓。

回答以下问题可以帮助您确定是否需要子许可证。如果您仍有疑问，请联系董事会，我们将与您一起确定是否需要申请子许可。

如果以下所有三个问题的答案都是“是”，那么您需要申请一个子许可证。如果这些问题的答案都是“否”，那么您不需要申请子许可证。

- 我的商标是否为商标（请参阅 Linux 基金会“商标”定义 link:http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/legal/trademark/faq[FAQ])？
- 我的标记是否按以下顺序包含以下相邻字符串：“Jenkins”，这些字母可包括各种类型的大小写，而在外国字符的情况下，也可以使用语音翻译。
- 我是否使用我的标记来识别与软件相关的商品或服务（请参阅如何在LF中再次link:http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/legal/trademark/faq[定义]该短语）？

可以在link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Approved+Trademark+Usage[已批准的商标使用]页面上找到项目批准的商标用法列表。

=== 商标归属

商标归属指南主要源自Linux Foundation link:https://lmi.linuxfoundation.org/programs/legal/trademark/attribution[trademark attribution]。

==== 通用归属

即使你使用 Jenkins 商标不在子 Jenkins 许可证的范围内，你仍需要注明所有权。有两种方式：

对于每个网页，广告或出版物，Jenkins 应该有相邻的“圆圈R”字符，如下所示：

Jenkins(R)

在您的网页末尾，广告，出版物或媒体广播，包括以清晰易读的字体和大小的以下文字：

[quote]
____
Jenkins(R) 是 Software in the Public Interest, Inc 的注册商标。
____

==== 子许可证持有人的归属

The Jenkins Sublicense Agreement sets forth how the mark should be attributed by
sublicensees. Sublicensees are required to place the following legend
conspicuously on each piece of authorized goods, and at least once in the area
of the title page of any documentation or sales literature accompanying each
authorized good or service:

[quote]
____
The registered trademark Jenkins(R) is used pursuant to a sublicense from the
Jenkins project and Software in the Public Interest, Inc.
____


The Jenkins project understands that space limitations can make including these
attributions difficult. When made necessary by space limitations, any
reasonable facsimile of these attributions may be used. In case of doubt as to
the proper shortened form, examples may be submitted to the Jenkins project for
approval.


== Project roles/stakeholders

=== Governance board

The governance board consists of three people who act as public representatives of the project, when such representation is necessary, for example to interface external entities such as SPI.

The board also acts as the ultimate decision-making authority in case disputes cannot be resolved via the regular project community meeting. The decision-making ability of the board is more symbolic and honorific, and it “rules” like British queens rather than a dictatorship.

The link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Board[Governance Board] page provides further information, including a list of current board members, and how to contact the board.

The process by which the Governance Board is elected can be reviewed in the link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Board+Election+Process[Board Election Process]


=== Infrastructure admins

Infrastructure administrators have root access to the various servers and build slaves that run +jenkins-ci.org+ and other sub-domains. They keep those servers up and running, installing new software, coordinating mirrors, handling keys and certificates, and making sure that we can keep churning out code.

Because of the sensitive nature of this work, infrastructure admins are by invitation only, and some of the activity happen behind closed doors. Infrastructure admins often appoint others to delegate some partial access to the system to complete some tasks.

A list of admins of some of the public infrastructure components can be found here: link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Infrastructure+Admins[Infrastructure Admins]


=== Core committers

Core committers are those who have push access to link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins[the main Jenkins repository] that produces +jenkins.war+. To become a core committer, one needs to sign the <<cla,contributor license agreement>>. One is not required to have a proven history of contributions before being granted commit access, but that doesn’t mean other core committers will never revert your changes.

The list of CLA signers is be maintained here: https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla


=== Plugin committers

Plugin committers are those who have push access to specific plugin repositories hosted under the jenkinsci GitHub organization. One is not required to have a proven history of contributions before being granted commit access. All you have to do is to ask. But that doesn’t mean other existing committers will never revert your changes.

=== Localization contributors

Localization contributors have push access to both the core and hosted plugins. They make localization/internationalization related changes to the code and resources, and they push those changes without seeking approval from the core/plugin committers.

=== Users

Users use Jenkins and its plugins. They contribute to the project by providing feedback, filing bug reports, prioritizing features and fixes for developers, helping other users, and making committers feel like their work is worth while.

== Communication

The communication among people in the community is crucial to the oneness of the project. People in the Jenkins project communicates with each other in several different places.

=== Mailing lists

We encourage mailing lists as the primary means of developer & user discussion, because of their asynchrony and ability to search the archive. The project website lists link:/mailing-lists[the active mailing lists and their purposes].

=== IRC

Jenkins project uses link:/chat[an IRC channel] for real time interactive communications. This is also the place where active members bond with each other.

=== Twitter

link:https://twitter.com/jenkinsci[@jenkinsci] is the official Twitter account of the Jenkins project, run by the infrastructure admins.

== Infrastructure

=== Source code

The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/[GitHub JenkinsCI organization] is where we host most of our code (see link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Repositories[the list of repositories] for easier navigation.) Because we previously used Subversion as the primary source code repository, we also have link:https://svn.jenkins-ci.org/[the subversion repository] that contains all the original project history. Some plugins are still actively maintained inside the Subversion repository.

To aid classifying our 1000+ Git repositories, some naming conventions have been adopted:

* plugins are named "*-plugin"
* libraries are named "lib-*"
* backend infrastructure programs are named "backend-*"

To encourage migration of plugins from Subversion to Git, a daemon is used to mirror plugins individually to GitHub. See link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Moving+from+Subversion+%28svn%29+to+Github[this page] for more about how to migrate your plugin to GitHub.

=== User Accounts

The infrastructure admins run an LDAP server and link:https://jenkins-ci.org/account[a small frontend program] to let users create accounts on jenkins-ci.org. This account is used for all the software that we run ourselves.

=== Wiki

This wiki that you are reading is our primary collaboration mechanism for documentation. This uses the LDAP server described above for access.

=== Bug tracker

link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/[Our primary bug tracker] is maintained by the infra admins. This uses the LDAP server described above for access.

=== Jenkins on Jenkins

We link:https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/[run Jenkins for our own development] and to automate various infrastructure tasks. Because of the sensitive nature of setting up jobs, only the infra admins have full write access.

[[meeting]]
== Decision making

The Jenkins project uses biweekly project meetings as the primary forum of decision making for matters that need consensus.
The meeting is link:/chat/#meeting[conducted on IRC] and open to anyone.
Agenda items can be added by anyone by simply adding your topic to link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda[the Governance Meeting Agenda wiki page].
Be sure to include your user name (so we know who proposed a topic).

The meeting minutes are public:

* link:http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/[2011 to September 2015]
* link:http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-meeting/[September 2015 to today]

The board serves as the ultimate decision-making body in case the project meeting fails to reach a consensus on a particular topic.

== How we develop code

=== Core

The core refers to a set of code and libraries that result in the +jenkins.war+ binary. link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins[The official core repository] is hosted on GitHub.

Long time committers push changes directly into this repository, although other core committers can still revert their changes and discuss them when they feel that is necessary. New committers can also do the same when they feel good about their changes, or if the changes are trivial.

Committers old and new who feel their changes need review use link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pulls[GitHub pull requests] as a way to solicit feedback. People without commit access also use pull requests to get their changes into the core. Core committers are expected to be attentive to pending pull requests, and try to act on them quickly.

Core committers generally use their own judgement to decide what to work on.

=== Releases

Every weekend a new release is built from the master branch and released, in various forms, including +jenkins.war+ and native packages. This allows us to get new features and bug fixes into the hands of users relatively quickly.

=== LTS Releases

Every three months or so we pick a prior release as the new long-term support (LTS) release and then create the ‘stable’ branch, from that release point. This branch gets important bug fixes backported from the master branch, and further patch releases are built roughly every two weeks until the next LTS baseline is chosen. See link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line[LTS Release Line] for more details.

=== Core Coding Convention

We roughly follow link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html[Sun coding convention] in the source code, and we use 4 space indentation and don’t use tabs. It's generally more practical and appreciated if you submit changes that don't change the code format too much as it eases the coding review job. Try submitting formatting changes and functional changes in separate commits.

With that said, we do not believe in rigorously enforcing coding convention, and we don’t want to turn down contributions because their code format doesn’t match what we use. So consider this informational.


=== Plugins

Plugins are developed autonomously by the people working on the plugin. Each gets its own repository, its own Jenkins-on-Jenkins job, its own bug tracker component, and maintain their own release schedules.

Some plugins are actively maintained by a small number of people and they may have their own local culture, such as different coding convention, additional commit policies. We do this so that people can feel ownership and attachment to their effort, and so that they won’t feel like they have to follow externally decided rules.

Since much of such local culture is implicit, it's often difficult to tell from outside the operating culture of a given plugin. The safe rule of thumb is to contact existing developers upfront before doing any commit (but if there's no timely response in a week so, you should feel free to commit.) Less actively maintained plugins tend not to have such local culture, so in those cases, if you feel lucky you can commit changes ahead and send a heads-up simultaneously, (and accept the possibility that the changes get reverted.)

Maintainer information should be listed in the info box of the plugin's wiki page. If you have trouble figuring out who to contact, the good fallback option is the developers' mailing list.

=== Plugin Wiki Page

Each plugin has its own Wiki page in https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/, such as link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin[this]. Plugin wiki pages should the macro that produces the stock header table, describing what the plugin does, along with the release history / changelog. Take a look at some plugin wiki pages as a guideline of what you should do.

These wiki pages are referenced from the update center built in to Jenkins, and they are the primary means through which users discover information about plugins.

=== Modules

Modules are libraries that are built separately from the core (much like plugins are), but are bundled into the WAR file as a JAR file in +WEB-INF/lib+ and therefore it behaves as if it's a part of the core from the users' point of view. Modules can be thought of as something in between a library and a plugin. It has its own POM, a set of source code, and built separately, like a library, but it gets the same compile-time processing as plugins do.

This assists splitting a big hair ball (that is the core) into more manageable smaller pieces, and allow OEMs to add/remove functionalities separately.

=== Commit guidelines

See <<pull-request,the pull request checklist>> for guidelines on submitting code to Jenkins.

=== Copying code from elsewhere

When you have a license to do so, and when that license is compatible with the MIT license, you can copy the code from elsewhere into Jenkins.

The most typical case of this is that the original code is licensed under a certain subset of the open-source licenses, such as ASL, BSD, and MIT license. Copyleft licenses, even though they are open-sourced, cannot be copied, such as EPL and GPL.

The code to be copied must be clearly marked with the license it is under, and when copying, you need to maintain the copyright/license attribution in the header. Please also indicate the origin of the copy as a part of the commit message.

In particular, this means we can copy Oracle Hudson's source code under the MIT license, but not Eclipse Hudson's source code under EPL.

=== Locally patching dependencies

Sometimes, it is necessary to make bug fixes and changes in the libraries that we use. Where the library is significant to Jenkins and the impact is considerable to our users, we choose to maintain local patch sets to upstream libraries, just like Linux distributions maintain such patches for its packages.

We normally intend such local patches to be integrated into upstream, so we file tickets upstream and provide our diff. When this works, this allows us to go back to the pristine upstream release at some point in the future. Those patch sets are maintained in our git repositories as a parallel branch.

In some cases, the supposed "temporary" patch sets became more permanent for various reasons beyond our control, such as the ceased development in the upstream, but that's only because that's how it turned out, not because we intended it at the outset. With the distributed version control system, maintaining parallel patch release for Jenkins isn't as hard as it used to be.

== How to join the project

=== Bringing in new plugins/tools/libraries

If you develop a plugin, we encourage you to co-host that with the Jenkins project so that other people in the community can participate. See link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hosting+Plugins[Hosting Plugins] for more details.

=== Making changes to existing plugins

If you are interested in just making a small number of changes without an intent to stay. It’s the easiest to send in pull requests through GitHub. See <<pull-request,using pull requests>> for more details. If your pull requests are not getting timely attention, please ping us via the developers' mailing list, so that we can resolve that.

If you’d like to be involved more seriously, in addition to the pull request, we encourage you to consider becoming a committer. Drop us a note in the IRC channel or the dev list, and we’ll set you up with commit access. Try to be courteous to existing developers by sending them heads-up and coordinating with them, but if they aren’t responding, don’t let that block your progress. The seniority of the developers are earned through on-going participation.

=== Helping and taking over dormant plugins

It is often the case that the original developer moves onto other things once the plugin becomes good enough for them (or if the original author changes the job and no longer has incentive to work on the technology.) So we encourage new developers or developers of different plugin to pitch in on other plugins’ pending pull requests or work on issues filed against them.

To that end, we also encourage people to pick up dormant plugins and consider them theirs. To do this, drop us a note at the dev list, and try to contact the previous maintainer to find out if they are still interested in driving the plugin. Trying insistently to contact the latest apparently inactive maintainer(s) before taking over is is an important practice to us. The practice is generally to add them in CC on your maintainership requests to the dev ML.

Many less active plugins do not really have any obvious owner, and they are collaboratively maintained by people making small changes and releasing them whenever the need arises. If in doubt, ask on the dev list.

=== Making changes to core

If you are interested in just making small changes without an intent to stay, the same process applies as plugins, described above. However, because core changes affect larger number of people, we’d be grateful if you’d try to go extra distance on the notes described in <<pull-request,using pull requests>>.

If you’d like to be involved more seriously, consider getting commit access. See the section about becoming a plugin developer for how to get this. In addition, we need to ask you to <<cla,sign the contributor license agreement>> (CLA).

When making changes, use your common sense. For example, if you are thinking about making a big change, it is recommended that you discuss your changes with the developers upfront. Or if you see that the part you’d like to work on has been actively modified by others, give them a heads-up.

=== Contributing localizations

We are always looking for people who can help localize Jenkins to different languages. If you are interested in helping, drop us a note in the dev list to get commit access, and see link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Internationalization[Internationalization] for the details of how to make changes.

[[pull-request]]

=== Using pull requests

As discussed above, Jenkins project uses pull requests as one of the main workflow to get the changes in. When you prepare your pull request, consider the following checklist as the best practice.

* See link:https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/[the github online help] for how to create a pull request
* We encourage you to file a ticket in link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/[the issue tracker] to describe the bug that you are fixing or the feature you are implementing. This creates a permanent record on our system that allows future developers to understand how the code came into the current shape. This is not a requirement (especially for small changes), but we appreciate if you do that.
* Refer to the ticket in your commit message by using the notation +[JENKINS-1234]+ where _JENKINS-1234_ is the ticket ID. This allows our scripts to understand the history and generate changelogs without human help. If you use the notation +[FIX JENKINS-1234]+, our bot will close the ticket automatically when the change is merged into the repository, and when the change is tested in our CI server. These notations create useful cross-references across systems, and are therefore highly recommended.
* We encourage you to have a test case for the code you added to avoid future regressions. See link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Unit+Test[Unit Test] for more details about how to write tests.
* Try to describe your changes so that other people understand what you did.
* Make sure you didn’t modify portions that aren’t related to your changes (most often caused by IDE auto-fixing import statements and other code formats.)

We do try to be attentive to inbound pull requests, but as you can see link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pending+Pull+Requests[here], unfortunately we can fail to resolve some of them in a timely fashion. If you notice that your pull requests aren’t getting attended to within a week or two, please drop us a note at the dev list, and please consider becoming a committer and push the changes directly. See link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pull+Request+to+Repositories[Pull Request to Repositories] for more.
