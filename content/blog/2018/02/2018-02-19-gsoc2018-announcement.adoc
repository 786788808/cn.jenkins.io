我们很高兴地宣布Jenkins项目已被link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code 2018]接受 。今年，我们邀请学生和老师加入Jenkins社区，并提各层次的介绍：核心，插件，开发工具和基础架构。

我们的导师已经创建了一些link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas[项目ideas].
例如，欢迎您致力于新的link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas/#jenkins-configuration-as-code[Configuration-as-Code initiative]或者帮助link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas/#code-coverage-api-plugin[编写代码覆盖率插件].
If you like test automation, there is a proposal to
link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas/#improvements-to-the-jenkins-acceptance-test-harness[Jenkins Acceptance Test Harness].
Over the next weeks we plan to extend this list by new even more project ideas.

All information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its link:/projects/gsoc/[subproject page].

== 我是学生。我如何申请？

See link:/projects/gsoc/students[Information for students] for application guidelines.

First step is to join discussions in the mailing lists in order to introduce yourself, establish connections with the community and potential mentors.
The application period starts on March 12 and ends on March 27, but don't let it misguide you!
Use time before application to discuss project ideas/proposals with mentors and to process their feedback.
To create a better proposal, we also recommend to study Jenkins and to do some contributions in the area of your project proposal.

Not satisfied by the current link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas[project ideas]?
You can link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas/#proposing-new-project-ideas[propose your own idea]
in the developer mailing list.

== 我想成为一名导师。是不是太晚了？

It's not!
If you are passionate about open-source and Jenkins, we invite you to join the mentors team.
You can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.
See link:/blog/2018/01/06/gsoc2018-call-for-mentors[Call for Mentors] and link:/projects/gsoc/mentors[Information for mentors] for details.

This year mentorship does **NOT** require strong expertise in Jenkins development.
The objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.
GSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.

== 关键日期

* Mar 05 - deadline for new GSoC project idea proposals
* Mar 12 - student application period starts
* Mar 27 - deadline for student applications
* Apr 23 - accepted projects announced, community bonding starts

See the link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline[GSoC Timeline] for more info.
In the Jenkins project we will also organize special events during and after GSoC (e.g. at Jenkins world).

**P.S:** I am going to create a special GSoC 2018 edition of swags for mentors and students. Do not miss them ;)
